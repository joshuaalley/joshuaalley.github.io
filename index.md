I am an Assistant Professor in the [School of Politics and International Relations](https://www.ucd.ie/spire/) at University College Dublin. 
My research focuses on international relations, with an emphasis on alliance politics and the political economy of security.
In my work, I explore the financial consequences of military alliances, democractic alliance credibility, and individual reactions to violence and coercion. 
Several other working papers examine the political economy of intra-state conflict. 
My work appears in *International Studies Quarterly*, *The Journal of Conflict Resolution*, *Research & Politics*, *Security Studies*, *International Interactions* and two edited volumes. I have also written opinion pieces for *[The Irish Independent](https://m.independent.ie/opinion/comment/joshua-alley-ireland-is-admired-for-its-un-peacekeeping-but-defence-leaves-a-fair-bit-to-be-desired/a2095372660.html)* and *[The National Interest](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/does-indo-pacific-need-alliance-nato-170896)*. 

[You can find my CV here](CV.pdf).

I received a Ph.D. from Texas A&M University in 2020, and hold a bachelor of arts from [Gettysburg College](https://www.gettysburg.edu/) (2015). Before joining UCD, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the [Democratic Statecraft Lab](http://statecraftlab.virginia.edu/) and [Department of Politics](https://politics.virginia.edu/) at the University of Virginia.

At UCD, I am part of [The Connected_Politics Lab](https://www.ucd.ie/connected_politics/), and help organize our [speaker series](https://www.ucd.ie/connected_politics/events/).
