I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the [Democratic Statecraft Lab](http://statecraftlab.virginia.edu/) at the University of Virginia.
My research interests center on the political economy of security, with a particular focus on formal institutions. 
My core research agenda explores the relationship between alliance participation and military spending, along with the domestic politics of alliances. 
Other working papers examine the political economy of intra-state conflict.

[You can find my CV here](CV.pdf).

I hold a Ph.D. from Texas A&M (2020), and a bachelor of arts from Gettysburg College (2015).  

I publicly version-control all of my solo-authored working papers, so manuscripts, data, and code are all available on [GitHub](https://github.com/joshuaalley).
