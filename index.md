I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Political Science at Texas A&M University.
My research interests center on the political economy of armed conflict.
My dissertation explores the relationship between alliance participation and military spending.
Other working papers examine the political economy of intra-state conflict.

[Here is my CV](CV.pdf).

I publicly version-control all of my working papers, so manuscripts, data, and code are all available on [GitHub](https://github.com/joshuaalley).
