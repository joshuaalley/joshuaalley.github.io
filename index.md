I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the [Democratic Statecraft Lab](http://statecraftlab.virginia.edu/) at the University of Virginia.
My research interests center on the political economy of security, with a particular focus on formal institutions. 
My core research agenda explores the relationship between alliance participation and military spending, along with the domestic politics of alliances. 
Other working papers examine the political economy of intra-state conflict. My work is forthcoming or published in *International Interactions* and two edited volumes. I have also written an opinion piece for *[The National Interest](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/does-indo-pacific-need-alliance-nato-170896)*. 

[You can find my CV here](CV.pdf).

I recently received a Ph.D. from Texas A&M, and also hold a bachelor of arts from Gettysburg College (2015).  

Together with Rosella Capella Zielinski, Kaija Schilde, Alexander Kirss and Ben Fordham, I am co-organizing an online workship series in the Political Economy of Security. The workshop gives scholars opportunities to receive constructive feedback and discuss bridging the nexus of political economy and security. You can find the workshop schedule [here](http://www.bu.edu/pardeeschool/research/project-on-the-political-economy-of-security/). 

I publicly version-control all of my solo-authored working papers, so manuscripts, data, and code are all available on [GitHub](https://github.com/joshuaalley).
