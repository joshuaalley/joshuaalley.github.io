I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Political Science](https://politicalscience.artsandsciences.baylor.edu/) at Baylor University. 
My research focuses on international relations, with an emphasis on alliance politics and political economy.
I am especially interested in democracy and foreign policy, the financial and political consequences of alliances, and the political economy of security.
My work is published in *The Journal of Politics*, *International Studies Quarterly*, *The Journal of Conflict Resolution*, *Research & Politics*, *Security Studies*, *International Interactions* and two edited volumes. I have also written for *[The Irish Independent](https://m.independent.ie/opinion/comment/joshua-alley-ireland-is-admired-for-its-un-peacekeeping-but-defence-leaves-a-fair-bit-to-be-desired/a2095372660.html)*, *[E-International Relations](https://www.e-ir.info/2023/10/21/what-do-we-know-about-alliances-and-military-spending/)* and *[The National Interest](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/does-indo-pacific-need-alliance-nato-170896)*. 

[You can find my CV here](CV.pdf).

I received a Ph.D. from Texas A&M University in 2020, and hold a bachelor of arts from [Gettysburg College](https://www.gettysburg.edu/) (2015). Before joining Baylor, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the [Democratic Statecraft Lab](http://statecraftlab.virginia.edu/) and [Department of Politics](https://politics.virginia.edu/) at the University of Virginia, and an Assistant Professor in the [School of Politics and International Relations](https://www.ucd.ie/spire/) at University College Dublin.
